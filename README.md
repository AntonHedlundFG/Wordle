# Wordle

Basic game functionality implemented, no flair, but a functioning game loop with start, play, end and restart.

TODO:
Add keyboard input, probably just GetKeyDown in the individual Keyboard Key prefab to Invoke the same methods.
Clarity during guessing phase - which line is currently being used?
Add some juice
Make the build look good, make sure strange resolutions doesn't kill the game, and set a background color or something.
